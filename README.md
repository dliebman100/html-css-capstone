# Simple.Eats

## Fair price point
Competing companies charge more than $10 per meal. Simple.Eats aims to lower the cost by using local restaurants to source ingredients. 

## Drop off wherever
We work with local restaurants in select locations to make it easier to pick-up and drop off the meals. Which means you have to worry less about your food sitting around if you're unable to meet the delivery time.

## Environment conscious packaging
We aim to use less harmful materials to the environment and our packaging is 100% recyclable.
